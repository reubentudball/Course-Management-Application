Task 1 (45 Secs)
Difficulty: 2 / 5
Comments: Difficulty with navigation of course page (double click unintuitive), but found it easy to understand where she had to go.
Task 2 (62 Secs)
Difficulty: 3 / 5
Comments: No easy way to view all deadlines inside a course page, did not immediately grasp that the calendar view was the way to view ALL deadlines
Task 3 (37 Secs)
Difficulty: 2 / 5
Comments: Once the question was errated, easily understood that the settings was the location to go to change settings of the app. However, first instinct was still to navigate to Notifications to change notification settings.
